# Diversity-Inclusive-Analysis

Aim:
Diversity and Inclusion is a company's mission, strategies, and practices to support a diverse workplace and leverage the effects of diversity to achieve a competitive business advantage. 
I was tasked to come up with a report showing how new hires, employees promoted, employees performance, and turnover are affected by diversity and inclusion (age group, gender, and nationality).

Diversity in the workplace has surpassed being a corporate trend and now is considered a business imperative for global organizations.

# Some key indicators were obtained from the report generated:

- Most hires for women are for lower grades.
- The only countries that might have benefited from Diversity and Inclusion for their new hires at FY20 are Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and France.
- FY19 (2.57) outperformed FY20 (2.41) according to the average performance rating.
- There's a significant improvement (as regards women's inclusion) for FY20 from Job level before promotion and Job level after promotion. We can't say the same for FY21...sadly.
